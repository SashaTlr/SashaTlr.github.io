      <h2>Diversity in Tech: The Gender Problem</h2>
      <h3>October 26, 2015<div class="line-break"></div></h3>

      <h4>Why women are being ignored by investors</h4>

      <blockquote cite="http://www.babson.edu/Academics/centers/blank-center/global-research/diana/Documents/diana-project-executive-summary-2014.pdf"> "There is an enormous untapped investment opportunity for venture capitalists smart enough to look at the numbers and fund women entrepreneurs.‚Äù - Dr. Candida Brush
</blockquote>
      <p>The dismal stats are nothing new. Women own <a href="http://www.babson.edu/Academics/centers/blank-center/global-research/diana/Documents/diana-project-executive-summary-2014.pdf">36% of all US businesses</a>, are founded by women, however, all-male leadership teams are more than <a href="http://www.babson.edu/Academics/centers/blank-center/global-research/diana/Documents/diana-project-executive-summary-2014.pdf">four times</a> as likely as companies with even one woman on the team to receive VC funding. Women are getting less than <a href="http://www.babson.edu/Academics/centers/blank-center/global-research/diana/Documents/diana-project-executive-summary-2014.pdf">five percent</a> of total VC funding. Only <a href="https://paulcollege.unh.edu/sites/paulcollege.unh.edu/files/webform/2014%20Analysis%20Report.pdf">36% of companies</a> seeking angel capital were women-run. The list goes on. While bringing awareness to this issue has certainly improved the situation for women, there is a lot more to be done, and the effort must come from all of us, not just women. Improving the ratio isn't just good for women, it's good for all of us. Investor Kevin O'Leary of Shark Tank fame recently said
        <blockquote cite=http://www.businessinsider.com/kevin-olearys-female-ceos-make-all-the-money-2015-5>"All the cash in the last two quarters is coming from companies run by women. "I don't have a single company run by a man right now that's outperformed the ones run by women... When you're doing venture investing like I am, it's startup to mid-level. They've got to work their tails off. They've got to work like hell... One thing's for sure: We should be elevating women to the CEO position because we're getting better returns. You don't need another reason in business. In my case, the numbers speak for themselves."</blockquote>

      <h4>So what do we do?</h4>
      <p>One step to changing the ratio is for us to acknowledge our implicit biases. Getting more women into VC investing will open doors for women entrepreneurs seeking funding, and will help to reduce the old-boys club that is the current state of funding. Of course, this is a bit of a chicken or the egg scenario, where women are hesitant to stay in VC due to gender disparity issues. VC firms need to make a real effort to support their women partners and understand that retaining women partners will lead to a more balanced portfolio, which will improve their bottom line. In the end, that's what it's all about, isn't it?
      </p>
      <h4>Don't leave it to the women to solve the problem.</h4>
      <p>Sure, we can tell women to enter the pipeline, go into STEM, go into VC, put yourself forward, but it's not just up to women to solve the problem. All of us have to be aware of our implicit biases, and have to choose to overcome our prejudice, whether it's toward gender, race, abilities, and religion.

      <p>At Project Entrepreneur, one of my favorite entrepreneurs, <a href="https://twitter.com/twinmiki?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Miki Agarwal</a> talked about the importance of defining your users to investors, because most investors were going to be of one demographic, and their understanding of the female demographic would come from their own wives or daughters, who quite frankly, did not represent the average female in terms of wealth or opportunity. I admit that I was naive to this, and remembered her point when I attended a lightning pitch event last week, where a women was pitching her makeup marketplace to a panel of four male investors. Her marketplace was meant to monetize on the surplus of beauty products women tend to collect, supported by stats such as women buying 100 beauty products a year and using only a fraction of them. The all-male panel was in total disbelief, and couldn't understand where this surplus was coming from. Meanwhile, I have a whole shelf dedicated to my stockpile of unused products -things that have come in packages, gifts, and free samples. The male panel followed up this stat with the question "Well, your average user must be a teenage, right?"... Um, no. Try 31. I was shocked! If there is such a disconnect between the investors and the addressable market of a company, even with the woman entrepreneur defining her users, how will investors believe in the product? The solution is not for women to only build products that cater to a population that male VC investors understand, but for investors to remember that consumers aren't just professional, white males.
      </p>
      <p>All is not lost, of course! There are a lot of investors out there who are working hard to change the ratio. Some notables are of course Kevin O'Leary, Kelly Hoey, Boriz Wertz, Jonathan Sposato, Alicia Syrett, Paul Graham, and Genevieve Thiers. The trend is constantly improving, and as we've seen progress in other industries, with increased awareness and proactivity, we are sure to see a change in ratio in tech, given some time.
