      <h2>Learning about version control, git, and GitHub</h2>
      <h3>October 3, 2015</h3>

    <p>
      When I worked in banking, I used Excel and Microsoft Word often. I was terrible about saving my documents, and would often make modifications to my work without making backup copies. I would have to dig through our snapshots, and hope that a snapshot was taken just before I added in my changes, but often, it hadn't.

      I very much needed to use version control so that I could track my changes, have multiple versions of my work, test how changes were impacting our results, and to experiment with my work without damaging the original templates.

      As a banker, I didn't appreciate the version control systems that our operations team tried to implement, as it was incredibly clunky, and was very time consuming to implement. Not only do similar issues exist in banking to when you work independently on code, but software is typically more of a collaborative effort, so you also need to be able to track how others are using the code. Version control allows you to organize collaborative and individual work, gives you the ability to experiment, revert back to older code, work simulataneously without interfering with each other's work, and gives clarity as to how a piece of code evolved and why.

        Git is a great system for version control. It is a very light (and free!) piece of softwareto use to tracks changes to code. Git has useful commands that can be used in the terminal (command line) to allow you to conveniently move modifications to the master files without overwriting the master code before it has been tested and approved. While git can be used for version control, it does rely on files to be stored locally. GitHub acts as a hosting service to allow teams to access these coding files remotely. GitHub also forces you to push your changes from Git to GitHub, and will not automatically override the master files with your changes. Once you have pushed your modifications to GitHub, a pull request needs to be created to review the changes, and only then can the files be merged.This allows for the opportunity to review any changes before overriding the source code, which reduces errors and bugs being introduced to the code. Of course, if there are problems, version control means that you can revert back to a previous iteration of the code.
