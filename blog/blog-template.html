How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
This was an interesting challenge. I have a natural tendency to lead, but I've always worked in settings where this has been an advantage. I also find it difficult to drive and have someone else navigate, as I don't do a good job of processing what I'm doing if I'm falling on someone else for guidance instead of figuring it out myself. Wireframing was especialyl challenging because it's more of a creative and aesthetic process as opposed to coding, which is a bit more systematic. We decided we wanted to create our own wireframes, so we timeboxed for 25 minutes, built a quick sketch independently, and then came back to go over our elements, figure out what was feasible, and assess our different strategies.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Wireframing is very helpful. It makes it much easier to break down the process of creating an outline template when there is a visual "goal" that you are building towards. It's a great anchor to build off of, and it also helps to make sure you haven't missed any important pieces.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
A good wireframe is simple but has a sketch of the various functionalities that you've decided are important. From a good wireframe, you can tell what the different components are, for example, a navigation menu, a header, an article, etc. but it isn't too refined or detailed to allow for quick iterations and improvements.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
We learned about the HMTL5 elements such as nav and article. Previously, I would have likely used div and wrapped the post itself in paragraph tags and and the navigation menu instead of using the article and nav tags, respectively.
