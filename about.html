      <p>I moved to NYC from Toronto in 2012 and haven't looked back. I grew up in Toronto and worked in the banking world for three years before being transferred to NYC. I spent two years in banking in NYC, took a year off to travel and work on some personal projects, and then enrolled in Dev Bootcamp to learn how to build in Ruby.
      </p>

      <p>I love to create. My favorite part of my banking job was building tools and models, creating things that other people could use to make their day better. I loved getting to build relationships with people across departments and functions, with all different types of skills and expertise. I am always building something across every kind of medium - furniture, crafts, processes, kitchen experiments, financial tools, sewing... the list goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
      I'm still a numbers person, and I have a solid understanding of markets and personal finance. In my dream world, I get to use my quantitative, developer, and creative skills to further financial empowerment. I can't wait to turn this dream into a reality!

        I have a Bachelor's in Life Sciences, with a Math Minor, from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. My Masters of Science is in Financial Mathematics from McMaster University, Ontario. I worked for 5 years in trading analytics for the Royal Bank of Canada, where I was quickly promoted and transferred to the NYC floor, and am now at Developer's Bootcamp in NYC. I have a strong quantitative background, but am a strong writer, researcher, and project manager. I have worked in India with The Catrinka Project to collect biographies and pictures of our artisans, as well as research potential sourcing. I have worked with Monarq to increase their Twitter engagement, run a competitor analysis, and be a Jill-of-all-trades.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've also taken any opportunity that I can to travel. I've seen Morocco, India, Dubai, France, England, Italy, Qatar, China, Hong Kong, Cuba, DR, and more. My all-time favourite experience was seeing the Terra Cotta Army and hunting down authentic biangbiang noodles while in Xi'an.

        I have a few quirks. I have an unhealthy obsession with dogs, and my life stretch goal is to have a doggy daycare. I have made two pairs of shoes by hand, from scratch, but I will never wear them (who will fix them if they break?). I have a massive sweet tooth and have been known to polish off a family-sized bag of M&Ms in a day. If that doesn't impress you, I'm not sure what will!
