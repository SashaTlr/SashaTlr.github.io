#Section 3.8 Reflection

##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
Margin is important! I became more comfortable using the DOM tree and Style panels in Dev Tools to find out when margin or padding was throwing off my formatting. I also practiced creating classes to adjust margin when needed.

##What did you learn about CSS positioning? I have a much clearer understanding of positioning, however, I still ran into trouble. In my index page, I used absolute positioning to keep the footer at the bottom of the site, but when I went to pages that didn't have much content, the footer would stick in the middle of the page. I created a separate class to fix this but I don't think I have a good solution yet. I have a much better understanding of relative and fixed positioning, and also got to practice using floats for my footer.

##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
The easiest part to implement was my skills list. I ended up turning it into an unordered list, and since we got to practice columns already, I used what we learned to make the list shift into columns. I read about how to make it responsive, and it turned out to be pretty easy to implement by using a minimum width field. I got pretty stuck on the footer as well as simply getting started. For example, I decided to start with the logo image since that's the first thing you see, but from a development perspective, it ended up being a time sink since I had to find a software to use to make the image which took some time.

##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
Positioning is still confusing! I am still having trouble with this concept and because our sites are so basic, I found I didn't get to practice much with my site. I think I will play around with the layout as we build up our content so that I can play with positioning on my site a bit more.
